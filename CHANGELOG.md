No changes yet.

## [0.5.5] - 2024-12-13

### Changed

- Bumped MSRV to 1.82 due to refactors to use methods like `Box::new_uninit`.
- Reduced size of the autogenerated C bindings code by dropping layout tests,
  which were expected to fail on non-Linux platforms anyway due to
  platform-specific code generation differences.
- Removed a hacky Cargo directive in the `aotuv_lancer_vorbis_sys` build script
  for linking to `libogg` in favor of letting the compiler to carry it over from
  `ogg_next_sys` by adding a `extern crate ogg_next_sys` statement, which is
  cleaner.
- Updated dependencies.

### Fixed

- Resolved an issue with undefined behavior in `VorbisEncoder` caused by C code
  potentially violating ownership and/or aliasing assumptions made by Rust code
  for boxed structs.

## [0.5.4] - 2023-12-10

### Changed

- Added `documentation` metadata to the project workspace packages to make the
  documentation slightly more discoverable on `crates.io`.

### Fixed

- Fixed `libvorbis` patch errata corrections not applying due to
  `aotuv_lancer_vorbis_sys` not being bumped in concert with `vorbis_rs`.
  `aotuv_lancer_vorbis_sys` and `ogg_next_sys` had their version bumped to
  apply this patch and other project README and metadata changes.

## [0.5.3] - 2023-12-10

### Added

- Added a logo for `vorbis-rs` in the project README.

### Changed

- Added a section to the `VorbisEncoder::encode_audio_block` documentation
  explaining important details about sample block size and encoding performance.
- Added a remark to the `VorbisEncoder::encode_audio_block` documentation about
  the usual numeric range of the input sample values.
- Bumped MSRV to 1.64 due to the new usage of workspace property inheritance
  features introduced in that Rust version.

### Fixed

- Corrected another errata in the `libvorbis` patch for the stack overflow
  fix of [0.5.1].

## [0.5.2] - 2023-11-25

### Fixed

- Corrected an errata in the `libvorbis` patch for the stack overflow fix of
  [0.5.1].

## [0.5.1] - 2023-11-25

### Fixed

- `VorbisEncoder::encode_audio_block` no longer causes a stack overflow in
  practical scenarios when encoding a large sample buffer. This overflow
  occurred when the available stack space was too small to handle the buffer,
  and usually caused segmentation faults.
  ([#17](https://github.com/ComunidadAylas/vorbis-rs/issues/17), thanks @emoon)

### Changed

- Corrected some minor pedantic Clippy lints.
- Slightly reduced heap allocations when decoding signals with more than two
  audio channels.
- Unified some minor cosmetic details of this changelog.

## [0.5.0] - 2023-08-06

### Changed

- The `VorbisEncoderBuilder::build` method now has a mutable reference receiver,
  making its usage more ergonomic and enabling more use cases.
  ([#11](https://github.com/ComunidadAylas/vorbis-rs/issues/11))
- Due to the above change, `VorbisEncoderBuilder` now automatically marks the
  stream serials it uses to build encoders for renewal, triggering their
  automatic replacement with different ones when `VorbisEncoderBuilder::build`
  is called. This behavior is meant to provide a reasonable default when using
  the same builder to build multiple encoders, but it can be customized by
  calling `VorbisEncoderBuilder::stream_serial` method before
  `VorbisEncoderBuilder::build`.

## [0.4.0] - 2023-07-29

### Added

- The `VorbisEncoderBuilder` struct was added for more ergonomic `VorbisEncoder`
  instantiation. The now obsolete `VorbisEncoder::new` method was removed.
- When the new default feature `stream-serial-rng` is enabled,
  `VorbisEncoderBuilder` can now automatically generate a random Ogg stream
  serial.
- `VorbisBitrateManagementStrategy` now has a `Default` implementation that
  targets a medium, usually transparent audio quality.

### Changed

- Removed unnecessary internal allocation in `VorbisDecoder`.

## [0.3.0] - 2023-04-14

### Changed

- `VorbisEncoder::finish` now returns the sink it was created with.
  ([#8](https://github.com/ComunidadAylas/vorbis-rs/pull/8), thanks @algesten)
- Updated author contact metadata for every crate in the repository.

## [0.2.0] - 2023-02-08

### Fixed

- Prevented `VorbisDecoder` from accepting `Read` implementations that borrow
  data that may be dropped while `VorbisDecoder` is referenced. Now
  `VorbisDecoder` behaves as if it owned the `Read` object. Previously, code
  that could cause undefined behavior was accepted, such as:

  ```rs
	let vorbis_data = /* Create some Vec<u8> */;

	// VorbisDecoder::new borrows vorbis_data for the duration of the function invocation
	let mut decoder = VorbisDecoder::new::<&[u8], _>(&*vorbis_data).unwrap();

	// The Vorbis data buffer used as a source for decoding may be freed later...
	drop(vorbis_data);

	// ... but safe code still can read from a deallocated buffer!
	while let Ok(Some(_)) = decoder.decode_audio_block() {
		eprintln!("Undefined behavior!");
	}
  ```

- Fixed a memory leak that occurred when `VorbisDecoder::new` returned unsuccessfully.

### Changed

- More idiomatic Rust representation of C library errors by using enums. ([#7](https://github.com/ComunidadAylas/vorbis-rs/issues/7))
- Optimized `VorbisDecoder` implementation to get rid of double indirection for the Vorbis stream source across the FFI boundary.
- Removed unnecessary reference to Minecraft in a rustdoc comment.
- Explicitly document the audio block format expected by the `encode_audio_block` method.
- Document I/O side effects of `Vorbis{Decoder,Encoder}::new`.

## [0.1.0] - 2022-10-21

### Added

- First public release.
