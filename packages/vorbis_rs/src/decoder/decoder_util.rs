		// while the pointers we got from C are thin, thus we need to convert each channel
		// sample pointer in the array to a fat slice pointer. To iterate over that pointer
		// array idiomatically, we also convert the first indirection level to a slice.

		// All of these pointers point to memory owned by vorbisfile. The documentation is not

		// documentation it can be assumed that this memory is valid until the next audio block
		// is decoded or ov_clear is called, whichever happens first.

		// either the borrow checker prevents clients from using a reference to us if they
		// call other mutable methods on the decoder, or the VorbisDecoder whose lifetime we're
