/// really is in an initialized state. Calling this when the content is not yet fully
/// initialized causes immediate undefined behavior.

/// This function is a backport of the unstable `Box::assume_init` method to stable Rust,
/// tracked by [issue 63291](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/63291).
// FIXME refactor this out once Box::assume_init is made stable, if ever
